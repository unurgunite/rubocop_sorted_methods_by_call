## Overview

This gem analyze Ruby AST and check if code was written according to the "waterfall" feature which give flexibility to
sources by declaring methods after they are called.

## Installation

rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call gem is quite simple to use and install. There are two options to install it — for those
who is going to contribute into the project and for those who is going to embed gem to theirs project. See below for
each step.

### Build from source

#### Manual installation

The manual installation includes installation via command line interface. it is practically no different from what
happens during the automatic build of the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/unurgunite/rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call.git && \
cd rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call && \
bundle install && \
gem build rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call.gemspec && \
gem install rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call-0.1.0.gem
```

Now everything should work fine. Just type `irb`
and `require "rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call/rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call"` to start working with the library

#### Automatic installation

The automatic installation is simpler but it has at least same steps as manual installation:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/unurgunite/rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call.git && \
cd rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call && \
bin/setup
```

If you see `irb` interface, then everything works fine. The main goal of automatic installation is that you do not need
to create your own script to simplify project build and clean up the shell history. Note: you do not need to require
projects file after the automatic installation. See `bin/setup` file for clarity of the statement

### Build via bundler

This documentation point is close to those who need to embed the library in their project. Just place this gem to your
Gemfile or create it manually via `bundle init`:

```ruby
# Your Gemfile
gem 'rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself for non bundled projects as:

```shell
gem install rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call
```

## Usage

All docs are available at the separate page: https://unurgunite.github.io/rubocop_sorted_methods_by_call_docs/

### Code examples

Positive case:

```ruby
# file.rb
def foo
  bar
end

def bar
  123
end

# main.rb
require "parser/current"

code = Parser::CurrentRuby.parse(File.read("file.rb"))
ast = RubocopSortedMethodsByCall::Processor.new
ast.process(code)
ast.ordered? #=> true
```

Negative case:

```ruby
# file.rb
def bar
  123
end

def foo
  bar
end

# main.rb
require "parser/current"

code = Parser::CurrentRuby.parse(File.read("file.rb"))
ast = RubocopSortedMethodsByCall::Processor.new
ast.process(code)
ast.ordered? #=> false
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add recursion support
- [ ] Add classes support
- [ ] Add struct support
- [ ] Add modules support
- [ ] Add nested structures support
- [ ] Add standalone method support (without invoking another methods inside)
- [ ] Add detection for method overriding (namespace pollutions)
- [ ] Support for method calling inside of params
- [ ] Refactor code base
- [ ] Make more examples for specs

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the
version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Requirements

This section will show dependencies which are used in the project. This section splits in two other sections —
requirements for common use and requirements for the development purposes.

### Common use
